An emerging generation of World Wide Web technology, known as the Semantic Web, offers tremendous potential for collaborative and interdisciplinary science. However, to realize this potential, scientists and information technologists must forge new models of cooperation, and new thinking must go into the funding and dissemination of this next generation of scientific tools on the Web.},
